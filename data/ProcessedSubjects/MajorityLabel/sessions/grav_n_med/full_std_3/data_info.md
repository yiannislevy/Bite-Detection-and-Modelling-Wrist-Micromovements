# Experiment Overview

## Basic Information
- **Date of Experiment**: `03-02-2024`
- **Data Type**: `Sessions`
- **Directory Path**: `data/ProcessedSubjects/MajorityLabel/sessions/grav_med_meanstd3`

## Preprocessing Details
- **Standardization**:
  - File: `data/dataset-info-json`
- **Labeling Approach**:
  - Majority Labels: `Yes`
  - Mid-Window Sample Labeling: `No`
- **Median Filtering**: `Applied`
- **Gravity Component Removal**: `Yes`

## Data Structure
- **Timestamps Included**: `Yes`
- **Window Structure**:  `20x7` (indicate if timestamps are included)

## Additional Notes
Data prepared according to instructions from Kyritsis from call. Removed gravity, median filtering 5th order, calculated
mean&std values after the previous 2 steps -> not windowed though - sequenced one after the other.
## Results Summary
Did `model.evaluate`.
Used models: `../models/full_loso/majority_label/processed/std_3/`
- Results:
  - **Easy Accuracy**: 79.57%
  - **Loss**: 63.53%
